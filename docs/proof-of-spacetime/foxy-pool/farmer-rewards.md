Foxy-Pools support crediting your farmer reward (0.125 XCH) directly to your pending balance instead of receiving it on your own wallet.
This can be useful if you want to directly pay out everything in a single coin to your payout address.

To enable, just set your farmer reward address to the pools address:

- CHIA: `xch1qjrct2gwv36jv0za8n0cec5sfxwa7yqx50aw9vc5n9lwjwa9tnqsyj377f`
- CHIA (OG): `xch1fnwgtlakr3t9622drh859m4rsr9r3qvmuhx9y2qf37yj7wnc00yqep7c5t`

See [this guide](../guides/changing-the-reward-address.md) on how to change the farmer reward address.
