## Getting started

1. To get started farming on [Foxy-Pool CHIA](https://chia.foxypool.io){target=_blank} please ensure you are using version 1.3.5 or newer of the chia-blockchain software from [here](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain/releases/latest){target=_blank}. Users also farming OG plots on Foxy can use the og-pooling enabled versions starting from 1.3.5 as well.
2. If you require some coins to create your PlotNFT you can use the [faucet](https://faucet.chia.net){target=_blank} provided by the Chia team.
3. Join the pool with your existing PlotNFT:

    === "via the GUI"
        First click on "Change Pool" to enter a new pool url for your PlotNFT:

        ![join pool step 1](../../../../assets/img/getting-started/join-chia-pool-1.png){: loading=lazy }

        Then enter the pools farmer url (`https://farmer.chia.foxypool.io`) and finally click on "Change" at the bottom:

        ![join pool step 2](../../../../assets/img/getting-started/join-chia-pool-2.png){: loading=lazy }

    === "via the CLI"
        Use the following command to join the pool. If you have multiple keys you will get asked which key to use.
        ```bash
        chia plotnft join --id 2 --pool_url https://farmer.chia.foxypool.io
        ```

4. Once your PlotNFT switched over to the pool an account is created for your Launcher Id. At this point you can log in to the pools [My Farmer](https://chia.foxypool.io/my-farmer){target=_blank} tab with it, or use the login link generated by your wallet to also [authenticate](authenticate.md).

## Verify your farmer is working correctly

To verify your farmer is working correctly, please check your logs for any pooling errors.
Pooling errors can be found in your chia `debug.log` when searching for `Error in pooling`.
