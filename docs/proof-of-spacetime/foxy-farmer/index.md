[Foxy-Farmer](https://github.com/foxypool/foxy-farmer){target=_blank} is a simplified farmer for the chia blockchain using the Foxy-Pool Chia Farming Gateway to farm without a full node running on your machine.

- [x] NFT and OG pooling are both supported!

!!! info "Note"
    If you can run a full node, you should!

Foxy-Farmer is useful in the following scenarios:

- You are replotting your OG pooling farm to compressed madmax NFT plots but do not want to run two full nodes
- Your hardware does not support running a full node
