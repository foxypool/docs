title: Foxy-Farmer
---

[Foxy-Farmer](https://github.com/foxypool/foxy-farmer){target=_blank} is a simplified farmer for the chia blockchain using the Foxy-Pool [Chia Farming Gateway](../chia-farming-gateway/index.md) to farm without a full node running on your machine.

- [x] NFT and OG pooling are both supported!
- [x] Bladebit compressed plots are supported!

!!! info "Note"
    If you can run a full node, you should!

Foxy-Farmer is useful in the following scenarios:

- You are replotting your OG pooling farm to compressed madmax NFT plots but do not want to run two full nodes
- Your hardware does not support running a full node

If you are migrating from FlexFarmer please check out [this guide](../guides/switching-from-flex-farmer-to-foxy.md).
