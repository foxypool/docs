---

[Foxy-Farmer](https://github.com/foxypool/foxy-farmer){target=_blank} is a simplified farmer for the chia blockchain using the Foxy-Pool [Chia Farming Gateway](../chia-farming-gateway/index.md) to farm without a full node running on your machine.

- [x] NFT and OG pooling are both supported!
- [x] Bladebit compressed plots are supported!
- [x] Gigahorse compressed plots are supported!
- [x] DrPlotter compressed plots are supported!

!!! info "Note"
    If you can run a full node, you should!

Foxy-Farmer is useful in the following scenarios:

- You are replotting your OG pooling farm to compressed NFT plots but do not want to run two full nodes
- You want to run a DrPlotter setup on a single machine
- Your hardware does not support running a full node
- You do not want to manage/run a full node
