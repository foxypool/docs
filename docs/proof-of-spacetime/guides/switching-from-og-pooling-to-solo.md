To switch from og pool farming to solo farming follow these steps:

1. Ensure the blockchain client is shutdown completely.
2. Edit the `config.yaml` and change the `???_target_address` (depending on the actual address prefix, e.g. `xch_target_address` for chia) in the pool config section back to one of your addresses so that block rewards are credited to you instead of the pool!
3. Install the official blockchain client software.
