[Pledge-Agent](https://github.com/felixbrucker/pledge-agent) is a small app which automates pledging and sending of coins via their wallets.

It can:

- send / pledge / commit coins only when exceeding a configured threshold
- keep a configured amount of coins in the wallet
- send to one address and pledge / commit to another with percentages defining how to split the coins
- attach messages when sending BURST to support some exchanges
- unlock a Bitcoin based wallet (BHD, LHD, XHD, HDD, DISC) with a configured passphrase
- send / pledge / commit coins from multiple wallets
- automatically remove pledge pointing to different addresses
- lock pledges (XHD only)
- stop pledging / committing when a configured amount is reached
